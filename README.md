# About
:man_artist:

Awful and confusing login form that doesn't allow you to submit it. Unless you aren't an admin...

## How to submit the form?
To submit the form user should use `admin` username and a password that contains more than 1 character

## List of feature enhancements
- Mobile support
- Buttons should not overlap the login form content
- Move buttons using `transform` instead of `top` and `left` coordinates
- Make it even more confusing
