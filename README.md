# About
:man_artist:

Awful and confusing [login form](https://kirillpd.github.io/build/) that doesn't allow you to submit it. Unless you aren't an admin...

## How to submit the form?
To submit the form user should use `admin` username and a password that contains more than 1 character

## List of feature enhancements
- Mobile support
- Buttons should not overlap the login form content
- Move buttons using `transform` instead of `top` and `left` coordinates
- SSR support
- Make it even more confusing

## FAQ
**Q:** Why do you use React for that application?

**A:** For fun! Of course, in the real world, we wouldn't use React library for such a small project.
##

**Q:** Why only admins can log in?

**A:** The author of the library has a dream to become an admin of at least something.
